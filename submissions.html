                    <!-- Manuscript Types -->
                    <section class="section">
                        <h2>Manuscript Types</h2>
                        <div class="card">
                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Original Article:</strong> Present original research findings based on empirical data. These manuscripts should include a comprehensive analysis of a clearly defined research question or hypothesis, along with detailed methodology, results, and a discussion that contextualises the findings within the existing literature. Original Articles are expected to follow a structured format, include a structured Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. The maximum word count is 6,000 words, with up to 50 references and a combined total of 8 tables and figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Review Article:</strong> Provide a critical and comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on a specific topic within the journal's scope. These articles do not present new experimental data but rather analyse and interpret findings from multiple studies to summarise the current state of knowledge, highlight key themes, identify gaps, and propose future research directions. Review Articles should include a unstructured Abstract, Introduction, Main Text (organised into sub-sections), and a Conclusion. Submissions may contain up to 8,000 words, 100 references, and a maximum of 8 tables and figures combined.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Mini Reviews:</strong> Concise articles that focus on recent developments or emerging trends within a narrowly defined area of research. Unlike full-length reviews, Mini Reviews provide a snapshot of current knowledge, making them ideal for covering niche topics or rapidly evolving fields. Authors should aim to clearly synthesise key findings, offer critical insights, and identify areas for future inquiry. Mini Reviews typically range from 2,000 to 3,000 words, with a recommended reference limit of 40 and up to 4 tables or figures combined.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Short Reports:</strong> Brief yet impactful manuscripts that describe original research findings. These submissions are appropriate for studies that offer novel insights but may not require a full-length article. Short Reports should be focused, with clear objectives, concise results, and well-articulated implications. A standard format including an Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and References should be followed. The word count should not exceed 3,000 words, with a limit of 25 references and a combined total of 3 tables and figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Case Study:</strong> Present detailed accounts of one or a few cases that illustrate rare, unusual, or novel clinical or food-related phenomena. These reports are valuable for sharing unique experiences or unexpected outcomes that contribute to the advancement of knowledge or practice. A Case Study should include an Abstract, Introduction, Case Presentation, Discussion, and Conclusion. Submissions should be between 1,500 and 2,500 words in length with references provided as appropriate and may include a limited number of tables and figures as necessary.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Perspectives:</strong> Scholarly essays that explore conceptual, theoretical, or emerging issues in food and nutrition science. These articles allow authors to present well-reasoned arguments, propose new frameworks, or reflect on the evolution of ideas within the discipline. Unlike opinion papers, which are more personal and informal, Perspectives are academic in tone and grounded in literature. They can address intersections between science, policy, ethics, and culture, offering readers a broader understanding of complex or evolving issues. Perspectives generally range from 2,000 to 2,500 words, short abstract of 100 - 150words, include limited references and figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Opinion Papers:</strong> Provide a platform for personal perspectives on key issues. These articles may cover controversial or emerging topics and are intended to stimulate discussion or offer fresh perspectives. Opinion Papers do not require an abstract and should focus on presenting clear, well-argued viewpoints rather than comprehensive literature reviews. The suggested word count is between 1,000 to 1,500 words. References and figures may be included where appropriate, but should remain minimal.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Commentaries:</strong> Short, focused articles that offer scholarly insight or critical perspectives on recently published articles, emerging trends, or key issues in food science, clinical nutrition, or public health. These submissions aim to provoke discussion, highlight alternative viewpoints, or clarify controversial or ambiguous topics. A Commentary may provide thought leadership on broader themes of interest to the readership. While brief in length, typically not exceeding 1,500 words, commentaries should be well-argued and supported by relevant evidence or citations. No abstract is required, and the inclusion of tables or figures is optional but should be limited.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Editorials:</strong> Generally solicited by the editorial board, though unsolicited submissions may also be considered. These concise articles offer insights, commentary, or reflections on relevant topics within the journal's scope. Editorials should not include an abstract and are limited to 1,200 words, with a maximum of 12 references and up to 2 tables or figures.</p>

                            <p class="content-text"><strong>Letters to the Editor:</strong> Provide a platform for readers to share concise feedback, raise methodological questions, or offer alternative interpretations related to articles recently published in the journal. Letters may also address emerging issues in nutrition science, public health, or food safety. Submissions should be brief and focused, typically limited to 800 words and up to five references. Letters may contain a small number of clarifying data points, but tables and figures should be used sparingly or omitted entirely. These letters are subject to editorial review and may be sent to the original article authors for response.</p>
